# SOC Platform Security Architecture

## 1. Zero-Trust Ingestion & Data Diode Enforcement
This platform is designed to operate strictly behind a unidirectional network data diode.
- **Read-Only Access:** The ingestion layer (`tail_to_redpanda.py`) exclusively reads local metadata logs via `tail -F`. It possesses absolutely no capability to transmit network packets back to the monitored environment.
- **No Decryption:** TLS inspection is explicitly forbidden. Threat inference relies entirely on unencrypted metadata (JA3 fingerprints, SNI, byte distributions).
- **Strict Validations:** All incoming logs are sanitized via `jsonschema`. Malformed payloads are synchronously dumped to `dead_letter_events`, preventing buffer overflows or injection attacks against the ML pipelines.

## 2. ML & Correlation Hardening
Machine Learning models in Python represent a significant attack surface (e.g., Pickle deserialization, OOM crashes).
- **Graceful Fallbacks:** If a Torch artifact fails cryptographic hash verification or platform constraints (ARM64 incompatibility), the pipeline defaults to a deterministic Mock ML classifier, ensuring 100% uptime.
- **Bounded State:** The `IncidentCorrelator` explicitly limits its tracking dictionary to `max_tracked_ips=5000` with periodic LRU eviction and 5-minute time horizons. This prevents algorithmic complexity (CWE-400) attacks where an adversary spams millions of spoofed IPs to exhaust SOC memory.

## 3. Container Isolation
- **Non-Root Execution:** The provided `Dockerfile` explicitly creates and enforces `USER soc_user (UID:1000)`.
- **Minimal Surface:** The image strips unnecessary package managers (`apt-get` cache cleared).
- **Network Segmentation:** Redpanda brokers require split internal/external listeners to ensure isolated container-to-container backend networks vs. frontend dashboard interactions.

## 4. Subprocess Execution Guardrails
The platform does not rely on active response scripts. There is exactly one subprocess call (`tail -F` in ingestion), which uses safe argument vectors (`['tail', '-F', file_path]`) explicitly preventing shell interpolation or command injection (CWE-78).
